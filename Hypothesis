I hypothesize that the suggested cis-regulatory regions identified for yellow and tan in D. guttifera (by Dr. Raja with the use of reporter constructs). Will show some conservation between closely related species of Drosophila and no conservation between distantly related species of Drosophila, due to the differences in abdominal pigmentation patterning between the species.
